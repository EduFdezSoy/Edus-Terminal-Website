# Edu's Terminal Website
Just my site, you can see it in action at [edufdez.es](https://edufdez.es)


## Description
This is a really simple site writed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it works like a Linux Terminal but it just JS and a bunch of code.

This is a static site, but with some work it can work with somme sort of API.

## Donations
If you really liked it and feel like I deserve some money, you can buy me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy) and I'll continue transforming caffeine into code!
