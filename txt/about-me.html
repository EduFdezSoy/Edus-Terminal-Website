<b>Hi! I'm Edu</b>, I'm SysAdmin and Developer and I'm probably making some weird shit right now (like this page).
I don't usually make webpages but here I am, writing this on a new one I develop in the last couple of days because I didn't like anything I found.
<br>
<b>What do I do?</b>
I manage sites and servers for a bunch of people and write weird stuff, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/EduFdezSoy" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, I usually upload all I can.
<br>
<b>And on my free time?</b>
80% reading manga
5% playing games
5% watching anime 
<b>and the last 10%?</b> SCIENCE.
Side projects, 3D, microcontrollers, learning new technologies or languages or even woodwork.
<br>
I think that's all I have to say, so <b>follow me, won't you?</b>
