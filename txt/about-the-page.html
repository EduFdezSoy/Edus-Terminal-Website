<b>Looks cool, uh?</b>
If you like it you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/EduFdezSoy/Edus-Terminal-Website" target="_blank">github</a>, it was made with CSS, JS and a little bit of me &#128150;.
No frameworks or libraries because I didn't like anything I found, so I writed it all.

If you REALLY liked it you can buy me a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy" target="_blank">coffee</a> and I'll continue transforming caffeine into code!
