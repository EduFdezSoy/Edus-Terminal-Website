<b>Dear recruiter,</b>
As you may know my real name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edufdezsoy/" target="_blank" class="no-url">Eduardo Fern&aacute;ndez</a>, but everybody calls me Edu as my nickname is <a href="https://twitter.com/EduFdezSoy" target="_blank" class="no-url">EduFdezSoy</a>. I'm sysadmin since 2011 (it all started when a younger me thought it was a good idea to put a Minecraft on a remote server, a CentOS) officially I'm titled since 2016, during those years I learned to program and I liked that so I studied it finishing in 2019 (You can check my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edufdezsoy/" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to know exactly what those titles are). 
<br>
<b>What am I good at?</b>
Some people said to me I'm good at solving problems. I guess that's because I usually know what's happening in systems and programs.
I don't think I'm that good at it, I only do what I know and search what I don't.
But I do think I'm good at programming, I can switch languages without any problem and keep writing code and I'm allways concerned about the performance.
And linux servers, linux servers are easy, everybody can do that.
<br>
<b>What am I bad at?</b>
Speaking. I'm really bad at speaking. Spanish or English I usually stutter a bit.
I'm also bad when social relations are involved since I have a little of social anxiety (I do what I can, I'm always trying to overcome it).
On tech related stuff I think I'm bad with designs, sometimes I have good ideas, like this web (really cool, uh?) but I usually just use a good and clean library for my proyects and hands on other thing.
<br>
<b>What am I searching?</b>
Ok, we're talking about ideals here, it can be hard to get to this high point:
One and only shift. Morning, afternoon or even nighttime (the systems do not rest) but only one, I hate when it's splited in two, even if it is only an hour. Most of my work is timeless, it doesn't matter when I do it, I want to have the other half day to me, I'd like to keep learning.
Remote friendly, I don't mind working from home or an office. Few hours a day, always or just some days, it always make me feel good. In the end I just like what I do and want to do it in my comfy place. Speaking of which, I am from M&aacute;laga and, for the moment, I am not interested in moving, but I will consider anything you can offer me. ;)
<br>
<b>What OS do I know?</b>
Years and years have made me a Linux expertise, I'm able to work on any Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, CoreOS, OpenWRT, Android or derivates. I also played with a bunch of other distros but I don't have the experience to call myself an expert on those.
I also know how to work with Cisco IOS (or at least I knew, since those are... infrequent).
On Windows I worked with a bunch of old servers (I can remember an old ActiveDirectory on a Windows Server 2000) the last thing I touched was a Windows Server 2012.
<br>
<b>What languages do I know?</b>
Starting with the ones I like the most and I'm more confident:
Kotlin, JavaScript (Server and Client Side), PHP and C#
I can do whatever you ask with those without even looking the net.
Other bunch of languajes I know but I usually have to search things to remember:
SQL, Java, C++, Net Core, Shell (bash, ash, sh, zsh, cmd and powershell), HTML, XML, CSS, SCSS, LESS... I may know some others but I cant remember all those things.
